/*

    IGN Ammo
    On collecting it increases the size of the player and its ammo count
    This is the blueprint for creating the ammo object with all the core behavior and properties

    Main properties:
        * sprite - p5.play sprite
    
    Other properties:
        * hue - color of the ammo object
    
    Methods:
        * update - basically checks if the sprite is colliding with the player blob
